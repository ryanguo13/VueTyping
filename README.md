# VueTyping

A simple static typing website build with Vue 3. 
I am currently trying to integrate the new version with Python Django. But up till now it is still a static website prototype.

## Usage
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ryanguo13/VueTyping.git
```

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

## Depoly
I have already build the project into the "dist" directory. So if you want to depoly on your server or object storage bucket, just use the "dist" directory.
